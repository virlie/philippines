      <h1>My Philippines!</h1>
      <h4>The home of my childhood.</h4>
      <p>Filipinos have long joked about the country having 7,107 islands, more or less, depending on whether it is low tide or high tide. Although the Philippines is not noted for having high tides, the new islands and islets would most probably be like those found in the Pag-asa Island group, composed of sand with the highest elevation being the top of the coconut tree.</p>
      <br>
      <p>What is intriguing about the new islets is the number of islets which may be large sand bars. These are typically made by the action of the waves and sea currents. Sand bars are also more transient, with some being formed quite fast, and then disappearing soon after, although there are also sand bars which have grown and where vegetation (including coconut trees) have sprouted.</p>
