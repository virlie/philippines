      </div>

      <h4><em>The Sweet Home of My Childhood.</em></h4>
      <p>There are three major islands in the Philippines. Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. Luzon is the largest and most populous island in the Philippines. It is the economic and political center of the nation, being home to the country's capital city, Manila, as well as Quezon City, the country's most populous city. With a population of 53 million as of 2015,[2] it is the fourth most populous island in the world (after Java, Honshu, and Great Britain), having about 53% of the country's total population.</p>

      <p>Filipinos have long joked about the country having 7,107 islands, more or less, depending on whether it is low tide or high tide. Although the Philippines is not noted for having high tides, the new islands and islets would most probably be like those found in the Pag-asa Island group, composed of sand with the highest elevation being the top of the coconut tree. The one island that I've been to, that completely disappears during high-tide is the Luli Island located in Honda Bay, Palawan. It's actually just 3 sandbars! </p>

          <p>There are two seasons and 4 climates in the Philippines.</p>

        <p>The seven warmest months of the year are from March to October. This is when a lot of the Festivals and/or Fiestas happen. Philippines is after all, a very Roman Catholic Country. Celebrations for specific Saints, Patrons and Harvests are going on, almost simultaneously all over the country. The best part of these festivities are the food, and the generosity of the people.</p>

      </div>
      <br>

      <p>My favorite Fiesta that I've been to several times is called Pahiyas in Lucban, Quezon. About an hour or so from where I lived.This is a celebration of the rice harvest</p>
      <p>Literal translation of the word Pahiyas means, Bejewelled. Every houses are decorated with gem colored rice paper shaped into everything one can imagine. Some of them have crystalized coconut sugar on the thicker rice papers for a glittery effect. The creativeness of the household are on display and their generosity is tested, as the customs dictates that whomever enters your house, you must offer food and water. That literally means, if you go in any house, be prepared to eat. They will feed you and you will only insult them by refusing their food. There is a joke (that is somewhat true) that the worst thing that can happen to a Filipino party is to run out of it. Someone could die, and we'll just make sure that the Ambulance people get some food to go with them. (If only I was kidding.)</p>
      <br>

      <p>And now, the bad part called the winter monsoon brings cooler air and  <a href img src="image/typhoonPhil.jpg" alt="an image of 'hagupit' in the philippines" class="text-danger"Danger Link>typhoons</a> from November to February. When most of the typhoons come hurling in. I saw several of these, actually more than I care to remember. These typhoons can and most of the time, will devastate, not only the harvest, the livestocks but more importantly, the people.</p>
      <p>Now that I've bummed you out, let me try to redeem myself by talking about everyone's favorite time of the year. Christmas Time!</p>
      <p>No one loves Christmas more than the Filipinos. We love it so much so that we start decorating everywhere and playing christmas music on the month of September!</p>

      <h4>Yes, you read that correctly. The month of <strong> September!</strong> </h4>

      <p>The only explanation that I can come up with for this phenomenon, is due to the fact that we do not have any other major holiday after the month of May until Christmas comes. There is of course Easter, but it is not a happy occasion. Feel free to click on these <a href img src="image/easter1.jpg"class="text-danger"Danger Link> links</a>, but I am warning you, it is <a href img src="image/easter2.jpg"class="text-danger"Danger Link>graphic </a>and <a href img src="image/easter3.jpg"class="text-danger"Danger Link>brutal</a>. Easter is not about bunny rabbits but about the crucifixion of Christ. It is not for the faint of hearts.</p>

      <h4>Let's talk about Food.</h4>
      <p>Because of the country's spanish collonial background, and chinese influences, from 400 years ago, a lot of the old traditional food stems from these places. The newer party players are american and japanese food, courtesy of World War II. (My gramma always said that there's always a silver lining!)</p>

      <p>Here's my favorite Filipino Food of All Time. Listed to the order of importance in my life.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Pancit - This is because, every birthday, this needs to be present. Noodles are representative of long life.</li>
        <li>Lumpia - Because it goes well with Pancit. Duh.</li>
        <li>Manggang Hilaw - Unripe Sour Green Mangoes.</li>
      </ol>
      <br>

      <p>I could go on and on about these foods, but this webpage is going to be a bit long, as it is, it's already taking up too much time. For now, I promise to keep working on this little blog for you, my dear. Keep in touch!</p>
