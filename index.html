        <h4><em>The Sweet Home of My Childhood.</em></h4>
        <p>Filipinos have long joked about the country having 7,107 islands, more or less, depending on whether it is low tide or high tide. Although the Philippines is not noted for having high tides, the new islands and islets would most probably be like those found in the Pag-asa Island group, composed of sand with the highest elevation being the top of the coconut tree. The one island that I've been to, that completely disappears during high-tide is the Luli<a href image src="image/luli1.jpg"> Island</a> located in Honda Bay, Palawan. It's actually just 3 sandbars! </p>
